# FitFlutter üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü¶ã

FitFlutter is a Flutter-based application designed to browse and download FitGirl Repacks.  It provides a convenient, cross-platform way to access FitGirl's extensive library of compressed game installers.  Think of it as a *very* unofficial FitGirl client.  This project is intended for educational purposes and to improve my Flutter skills.

## Known Issues üêõ

These issues have been reported by tester and may not affect all users:

* **Windows 10 Transparency:** On Windows 10, the entire application window may appear transparent.
* **Windows 10 Drag Lag/Cursor Copying:** On Windows 10, dragging the application window can be slow and may create visual artifacts, like multiple copies of the cursor.  This seems to be related to window redrawing.
* **Limited Testing:** The application has had limited testing (only one tester), these issues might not reproduce on all devices.
