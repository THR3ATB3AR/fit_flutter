# FitFlutter üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü¶ã

FitFlutter is a Flutter-based application designed to browse and download FitGirl Repacks.  It provides a convenient, cross-platform way to access FitGirl's extensive library of compressed game installers.  Think of it as a *very* unofficial FitGirl client.  This project is intended for educational purposes and to improve my Flutter skills.

**Disclaimer:**  This application is not affiliated with or endorsed by FitGirl.  Using this application to download copyrighted material without permission is illegal in many jurisdictions.  You are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations.  Use this application at your own risk. I am not responsible for how you use it.

## Known Issues üêõ

These issues have been reported by testers and may not affect all users:

* **Windows 10 Transparency:** On Windows 10, the entire application window may appear transparent.
* **Windows 10 Drag Lag/Cursor Copying:** On Windows 10, dragging the application window can be slow and may create visual artifacts, like multiple copies of the cursor.  This seems to be related to window redrawing.
* **Limited Testing:** The application has had limited testing (only one tester), these issues might not reproduce on all devices.
