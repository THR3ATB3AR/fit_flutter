FitFlutter is a Flutter-based application designed to browse and download FitGirl Repacks.  It provides a convenient, cross-platform way to access FitGirl's extensive library of compressed game installers.  Think of it as a *very* unofficial FitGirl client.  This project is intended for educational purposes and to improve my Flutter skills.

## Roadmap & Future Enhancements üöÄ

FitFlutter is continuously evolving!  Here's a glimpse of what's coming:

I am open for contributions and suggestions!

## Known Issues üêõ

This section lists known issues that have been reported.  While these issues have been observed, they may not affect all users or all devices.  We are working to resolve them.

* **Null Check Errors:**  If you encounter a Null Exception or a similar "null check" error, deleting the application's settings file will likely resolve the issue.
  * **Windows:** Delete the settings file located at `%APPDATA%\com.example\fit_flutter\FitFlutter`.
  * **Android:** Clear the application's data through your device's settings menu (usually found under "Apps" or "Application Manager").
* **Aero Theme** The aero theme causes lag on window drag in Windows 11.
* **Limited Testing:** The application has undergone limited testing primarily on a single device/configuration.  Therefore, some issues may be specific to certain devices, operating system versions, or user configurations.  We are actively seeking broader testing to identify and address such issues.
